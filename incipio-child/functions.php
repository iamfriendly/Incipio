	This is an example child theme. If you want to edit the way this theme works, then you
	should do that in this file (or the attached style.css to edit the styles).

	Most of our functions are wrapped in if( !function_exists() ) calls which means you can
	simply overwrite them in this file and your version of that function will run in your
	child theme.

	We've also libreally used filters and actions throughout our framework which means you 
	can easily adjust certain fecets of your theme.
