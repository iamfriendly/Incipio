		This is an example child theme. You will see that, above, under 'Template' we have
		specified that it is to be a child theme of Incipio. This means that it will take on
		all of the Incipio options and settings.

		Child themes are really important for both you, our customer and for us, the 
		developers. They allow you to make any adjustments you want to your theme without
		affecting the 'core' (parent) theme which means we can provide updates to the core
		theme (such as bug fixes and new features) whilst your custom modifications stay
		in tact. They are incredibly powerful.

		In order to take on the base styles from Incipio, we need to include the stylesheet
		from that theme, we'll do that on the following line:

	If you want to modify, remove or add your own styles then you should do so below this
	comment block. If you wish to edit the way the theme functions, then you should take a
	look at some examples in the functions.php file in this child theme folder.
